        - `update_stock(self, quantity)`: Method to update the stock of the product.
        - `__str__(self)`: Return a string representation of the product.

2. **Class `Order`**:
    - Attributes:
        - `order_id` (string)
        - `products` (list of tuples with `Product` and quantity)
        - `total_price` (float)
    - Methods:
        - `__init__(self, order_id)`: Constructor to initialize attributes. Initialize `products` as an empty list and `total_price` as 0.
        - `add_product(self, product, quantity)`: Method to add a product to the order and update the total price.
        - `__str__(self)`: Return a string representation of the order.

### Exercise 4: Employee Management System

Develop a class-based system for managing employees in a company.

        - `salary` (float)
    - Methods:
        - `__init__(self, employee_id, name, position, salary)`: Constructor to initialize attributes.
        - `__str__(self)`: Return a string representation of the employee.

2. **Class `Manager` (inherits from `Employee`)**:
    - Additional Attributes:
        - `managed_employees` (list of `Employee` objects)
    - Methods:
        - `__init__(self, employee_id, name, position, salary)`: Constructor to initialize attributes. Initialize `managed_employees` as an empty list.
